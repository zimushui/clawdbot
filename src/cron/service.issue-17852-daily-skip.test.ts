/**
 * Regression test for issue #17852: daily cron jobs skip a day (48h jump).
 *
 * Root cause: onTimer's results-processing block used the full
 * recomputeNextRuns which could silently advance a past-due nextRunAtMs
 * for a job that became due between findDueJobs and the post-execution
 * locked block — skipping that run and jumping 48h ahead.
 *
 * Fix: use recomputeNextRunsForMaintenance in the post-execution block,
 * which only fills in missing nextRunAtMs values and never overwrites
 * existing (including past-due) ones.
